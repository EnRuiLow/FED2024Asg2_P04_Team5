# MokeSell by Ser Hao and En Rui
Our project is about an ecommerce website, where it actually allows people to actually list and purchase people's listing. So all that you would need is to have an account, once logged in, you would also be introduced to our spin-the-wheel gamification feature. This wheel feature would actually provide you with chances to win discounts on your purchase. With this wheel, you get to stand a chance to win discounts up to 8 dollars. After logging in, you would be introduced to the home page where all the listings of other users would be displayed. From there, you can click into the listing and you have options to either chat with the seller or offer a price for the product listed. You would also be able to click into the users profile to check for the things that the seller has listed. 

Meanwhile, you could also create your own profile by pressing on your own name at the top right hand corner. We also have some other cool features, such as the following page, notifications, chat and sell page. The following page shows users that you have followed and also other people on the website. The notifications page allows you to check out your own offers and the chat page allows you to chat with the sellers in order to settle for a price, just like how it would normally be like in a physical store. Lastly, there is the "Sell" button which allows people to list their products, and at the same time show a picture of whatever they are selling. There is also a search bar at the top that would help the user find their products more efficiently, by searching both the title and the description of the listing. The listing also goes by which one had the most views, counted by the click ins to the product. So the more clicks that this product gets, the more popular it is. There is also a sorting button at the home page which allows the users to know which listing was the most recent, most popular, lowest to highest price etc. 

## Design Process
Our website was made in order to help the user be able to not just buy, but also be able to sell. This could be done by of course, our sell feature, where they could list products that they might not need. Our website also has thsi special gamification feature, which is the spin the wheel gamification feature which not a lot of websites actually offer, but we offer this to our customers, especially students like us, as they would not only need to spend lesser amount of money buying whatever they need, and they could get these discounts daily. As long as they sign in.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - Gamification: We have allowed the users to actually spin the wheel for a chance to win themselves some discounts.

Feature 2 - Profile Management: We have actually allowed the users to customise their own profiles, by letting them change their profile pictures.

Feature 3 - Follow Feature: We have also actually allowed the users to follow other fellow users on the app, thus putting them as a "priority" above other users.

Feature 4 - Account Creation and Login: Users can actually create accounts and log into the platform

Feature 5 - Listing Management: We actually allowed users to create listings, have active listings limit, and included listing expiry so that everyone's listings would have a chance to 

Feature 6 - Communication and Transactions

Feature 7 - 

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Assistive AI
In this section you should document the process of using AI tools eg, ChatGPT, Gemini etc to help you with the development of features/functionalities of your web application. (Failure to document your use of AI tools will result in loss of marks.) Example below:

Spotify API: ChatGPT was used to help with the implementation of the Spotify API (include screenshots of generated AI codes.)

## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
