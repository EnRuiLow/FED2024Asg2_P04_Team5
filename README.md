# MokeSell by Ser Hao and En Rui
Our project is about an ecommerce website, where it actually allows people to actually list and purchase people's listing. So all that you would need is to have an account, once logged in, you would also be introduced to our spin-the-wheel gamification feature. This wheel feature would actually provide you with chances to win discounts on your purchase. With this wheel, you get to stand a chance to win discounts up to 8 dollars. After logging in, you would be introduced to the home page where all the listings of other users would be displayed. From there, you can click into the listing and you have options to either chat with the seller or offer a price for the product listed. You would also be able to click into the users profile to check for the things that the seller has listed. 

Meanwhile, you could also create your own profile by pressing on your own name at the top right hand corner. We also have some other cool features, such as the following page, notifications, chat and sell page. The following page shows users that you have followed and also other people on the website. The notifications page allows you to check out your own offers and the chat page allows you to chat with the sellers in order to settle for a price, just like how it would normally be like in a physical store. Lastly, there is the "Sell" button which allows people to list their products, and at the same time show a picture of whatever they are selling. There is also a search bar at the top that would help the user find their products more efficiently, by searching both the title and the description of the listing. The listing also goes by which one had the most views, counted by the click ins to the product. So the more clicks that this product gets, the more popular it is. There is also a sorting button at the home page which allows the users to know which listing was the most recent, most popular, lowest to highest price etc. 

## Design Process
Our website was made in order to help the user be able to not just buy, but also be able to sell. This could be done by of course, our sell feature, where they could list products that they might not need. Our website also has thsi special gamification feature, which is the spin the wheel gamification feature which not a lot of websites actually offer, but we offer this to our customers, especially students like us, as they would not only need to spend lesser amount of money buying whatever they need, and they could get these discounts daily. As long as they sign in.

## Features

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - Gamification: We have allowed the users to actually spin the wheel for a chance to win themselves some discounts.

Feature 2 - Profile Management: We have actually allowed the users to customise their own profiles, by letting them change their profile pictures.

## Testing
Selling page:
Go to the "Sell" page
Try to list an item, with everything filled in, then go back to the home page, where the listing should be up, and then press on the listing. Everything over there should be fine, just like how the video showcased.
